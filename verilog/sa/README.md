99 TSP - Verilog Simulated Annealing
====================================

Welcome to my Verilog solution to the Travelling Salesman Problem!

This being Verilog, it's designed to run on hardware. The board I used to develop this solution on is the Mojo v3 board (and therefore the Xilinx ISE toolchain).

That said, this solution is built so that you can import the algorithm into any project, regardless of the underlying hardware.
