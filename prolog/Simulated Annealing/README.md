# This is my SWI - Prolog Solution for the Traveling Salesman Solution

This solution is supposed to be of a Simulated Annealing Algorithm



To run the program right now, 

run the command on the terminal/ command line, 

 swipl  main.pl -t main --quiet -- example.tsp
 
 
where example.tsp is the file you would like to parse. 

You must have swipl installing on your computer in order to run this.
