# This is my SWI - Prolog Solution for the Traveling Salesman Solution

This solution is supposed to be of a Simulated Annealing Algorithm



in order to run the solution at the moment on Windows, 

You have two choices. 

You have to load the file using consult('testing.pl'),

and then running the command start(File, Temp, Temp_to_reach, and constant) on the Swi-Prolog terminal,

where the File is the path that the file is held in,


and temp, temp_to_reach, and constant are numbers for how long you want the program to run until.


OR you can 

load test_example.pl, 

and call test_example. on the swi command line


Both of these choices will output 

the distance 

and the path the algorithm thought of as the current solution
