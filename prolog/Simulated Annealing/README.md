# This is my SWI - Prolog Solution for the Traveling Salesman Solution

This solution is supposed to be of a Simulated Annealing Algorithm



in order to run the solution at the moment on Windows, 

You have to load the file using consult('testing.pl'),

and then running the command start(File, Temp, Temp_to_reach, and constant) on the Swi-Prolog terminal,

where the File is the path that the file is held in,


and temp, temp_to_reach, and constant are how fast you want

the solution to converge, and how likely you want

the solution to converge to its neighbor, 


even if the solution is worse off at the time.
